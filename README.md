**Software Development Practice that Works**

This project is a work in progress, a philosophy about software development, architecture, and engineering.

## Is this Agile?

Yes, this 100% compatible with the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

## Value Attention

That meeting could have been an email / chat thread.

How much time does a 15-minute meeting cost? Too much, and it puts the required attendees in a difficult position of excusing the distraction cost.

Asynchronous communication is better than scheduled meetings. Leave those meetings for when they are truly necessary, so the audience can give good attention.

## It's safe to give time estimates

You don't need to obfuscate time estimates with story points, velocity formulas, or burndown charts. "This should take three days" is a very reasonable string of words to communicate effectively.

## You can't predict everything

But you can affect your probability of success and delivery. Report what factors are helping and which ones are slowing things down without waiting for a meeting.

## Stories tell what happened

Having a task with clear outcomes and a general direction is great, but don't waste time on noisy documentation about the boring parts. Get the thing done, then fill the details in your report with useful information about what works.

**Software Development Practice that Works**

This project is a work in progress, a philosophy about software development, architecture, and engineering.

## Is this Agile?

Yes, this 100% compatible with the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

## Value Attention

That meeting could have been an email / chat thread.

How much time does a 15-minute meeting cost? Too much, and it puts the required attendees in a difficult position of excusing the distraction cost.

Asynchronous communication is better than scheduled meetings. Leave those meetings for when they are truly necessary, so the audience can give good attention.

## It's safe to give time estimates

You don't need to obfuscate time estimates with story points, velocity formulas, or burndown charts. "This should take three days" is a very reasonable string of words to communicate effectively.

## You can't predict everything

But you can affect your probability of success and delivery. Report what factors are helping and which ones are slowing things down without waiting for a meeting.

## Stories tell what happened

Having a task with clear outcomes and a general direction is great, but don't waste time on noisy documentation about the boring parts. Get the thing done, then fill in the details of your report with useful information about what works and what doesn't.

## Arbitrary deadlines are arbitrary

We have continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) now. You don't need to wait for multiple two-week cycles to get things done. The planning meeting is scheduled for any time planning needs to happen.

When you sprint, you should be laser-focused on the goal, powered by preparation, and delivering at maximum speed with a clear path forward. This is intense, and sprinters should not be interrupted or distracted while sprinting. When the goal is reached, it is expected that the sprinter take a moment to recover from exhaustion.

If you are constantly in a state of "sprint", that is not sprinting.

Deadlines should be meaningful, and carefully. As part of valuing attention, arbitrary deadlines can be stressful and distracting while impacting quality.
